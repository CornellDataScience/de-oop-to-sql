# DiscreetORM
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CornellDataScience/de-oop-to-sql.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CornellDataScience/de-oop-to-sql)

DiscreetORM is a type-safe minimal-hassle easy-to-use ORM (object relational mapping) for TypeScript developed by CDS at Cornell University.

DiscreetORM is under development and currently supports:
* Database backed class instantiation with decorators.
* Database backed object updates with decorators on static functions.

Currently DiscreetORM only writes to a commands.sql file without any DBMS instance running and processing the commands. This is planned.
